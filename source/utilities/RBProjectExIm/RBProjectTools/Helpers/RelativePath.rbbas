	#tag Note, Name = About
		Provided by Jonathan Johnson:
		
		<http://www.nilobject.com/?p=239>
		
		Changes made by TT:
		
		- the actually used path separator is prepended to the path and used for resolving
		- disabled "relativePathParts.Append kSameDirPath" to avoid paths such as "./file.txt"
		- catches exceptions in ResolveRelativePath and returns nil
		- added DisplayPath()
		- added IsRelPathLocal
		- added createFolders parameter to ResolveRelativePath

	#tag Note, Name = Sorting of items
		Both the project items (blocks) and items inside (groups) them can be sorted
		upon request by the 'ordered' parameter in some of the functions here.
		
		Sorting makes sense wherever you want to find duplicate entries or
		compare a set of entries to a similar set, perhaps of a different version of
		the same project. The sorting is necessary for these purposes because the
		IDE sometimes changes the order of items randomly. For instance, the
		"PDef" (Property) entries often get reordered when changing a project
		in RB 2005 and 2006r1.
		
		See also the "Note on sorting" in RBPrjItemsTreeBuilder!
		
		
		Sorting root items (project items)
		-------------------------------
		
		When requesting a sorted list of children of the root (which would be the
		"block" items), these children are simply ordered by a concatenated string
		of their tag and their containing 'name' tag's value, or, if there is not such
		tag inside the block, by their original order in the tree.
		
		Sorting these blocks does still preserve the project integrity, however, it
		changes the order how the project items (modules, classes, windows, etc)
		appear in the "Project" tab's list inside the IDE. So, be careful not to use
		this reordered list to save a write project file unless you want to shuffle
		the user's carefully arranged items around. However, this option is useful
		when you want to compare the contents of a project with another, so you
		can see the difference in code even if the user just changed the visual
		order of the items in the project.
		
		Sorting deeper items (group items)
		-------------------------------
		
		When requesting a sorted list of deeper items, the sorting is more complicated:
		
		Some items must not be reordered because their order has an important
		meaning, most times by implicitly specifying an index to the item. This is
		the case, for instance, for Controls, ControlBehaviors and MenuItems. There
		may be others as well.
		
		Because of this, only certain items will be sorted, i.e. those that are known
		not ever to rely on their order.
		
		These are the rules applied for determining which items can be reordered:
		
		1. Leaf items are never reordered
		2. Non-leaf items (= group items) are only considered for sorting if their
		tag code is one of the known ones not to rely on a fixed order.
		3. Group items that are considered for sorting will be reordered amoung
		themselves, i.e. amoung those of the same tag code, only.
		4. Reordered items will be sorted in after non-reordered items, and be
		sorted by their tags
		
		Example
		--------
		
		Original (unsorted):
		
		  name: Foo
		  clss: FooClass
		  PDef: { name: item1; ... }
		  PDef: { name: item2; ... }
		  Meth: { name: method2; ... }
		  Meth: { name: method1; ... }
		  CBix: 0
		
		Sorted:
		
		  name: Foo
		  clss: FooClass
		  CBix: 0
		  Meth: { name: method1; ... }
		  Meth: { name: method2; ... }
		  PDef: { name: item1; ... }
		  PDef: { name: item2; ... }
		
		Here, "name", "clss" and "CBix" were not sorted, while the contents of
		"Meth" and "PDef" were sorted, as well as Meth entries got sorted before
		PDef items.
		
		The entire classification for this sorting is happening in

	#tag Note, Name = About
		This class collects all data into a tree of RBPrjItem objects
		
		It also predetermines the items' values for later sorting by setting their "theOrderValue" property
		
		This tree ('RBPrjItemsTree') then has the same structure as the original project file had
		
	#tag EndNote

	#tag Note, Name = Note on sorting (ordered items)
		When the functions in this class add items to the tree, those items' value for a
		possible sorting later, e.g. via RBPrjItem.Children(true), is predetermined here
		by the insertion code already.
		
		This means that if one modifies the items in the tree later, their ordering position
		will not be adequately updated. I should eventually change this, but for now the
		solution would be to use this Builder class to recreate a new tree from the modified
		one to get a proper sorting again.

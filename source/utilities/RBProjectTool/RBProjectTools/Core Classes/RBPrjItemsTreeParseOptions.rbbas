			Sorts the groups (sub blocks) as much as possible.
			E.g, PVal/PDef entries can be sorted, while Controls inside a Window must not be sorted
			because their order is significant for their index.

			External items can be specified in several ways: by Alias (Mac only), absolute path and relative path.
			This option makes sure there is only and exactly one relative path

			Removes editor related information from code related project items such as cursor position
			and text selection.
			This option is only relevant to projects saved with RB versions 5.x and before. RB 200x
			does store the editor state in a separate block which will not be touched by this option.

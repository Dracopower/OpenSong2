	#tag Note, Name = RB Project Format
		RB Project files exist in two formats: XML and Binary
		Both represend the same data structure in two forms.
		The here included "RBPrjTextFileWriter" class writes a 3rd form, which
		is also mainly text based, but more brief than the XML format.
		
		The idea is to use "RBPrjProcessing" as a parser for all 3 formats
		in the same way, so that one can both read and write prj files in
		all these formats and route them all thru the same channel for
		processing.

	#tag Note, Name = External Project Items
		External Projects Items are classes, modules, windows and other code items that
		you can Export individually as .rbo (or .rbw, .rbm) files to a separate place on your
		disk.
		
		You can use such External Items by dragging them back into your project while
		holding down the Command and Options (Mac) or Control and Alt (PC) keys.
		The such imported item will appear in italics and with a little arrow in its icon
		to tell you that this item is an External Item, meaning that it's not stored inside
		your .rbp file but in a separate file.
		
		The advantage of External Items is that you can share them between several
		projects: If you change the item within one project, it will affect other projects
		using this same item as well, as they all refer to the same file on the disk.
		
		
		Version Control with External Items
		-------------------------------
		
		Now, here comes the tricky part: The Vault Ex/Import feature of these tools can
		also handle external items. But if you'd then try to use them with a version control
		system such as SubVersion or CVS, it gets complicated easily.
		
		Therefore, the following rules are currently applied when you export or import a
		RB project to a so-called "vault" folder for version control:
		
		On Export To Vault:
		- All items of the project, including the external items, will be stored inside the
		   vault folder next to the main project file.
		
		On Import From Vault:
		- If an external item was stored in a folder that is in the same or a deeper folder
		   from there the main project file is located, then it will be restored in the same
		   place (and folders will be recreated as necessary)
		- If an external item was stored in a folder outside of the main project's folder,
		   and if that folder is not accessible, then it will be created in a new folder called
		   "Relocated External Items" next to the main project file.

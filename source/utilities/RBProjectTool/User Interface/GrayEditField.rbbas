	#tag Note, Name = About
		Formerly "GrayEditClass"
		Original version of this class was created in May 1999 by Stone Table Software.
		Download link of original version:
		  <http://www.stonetablesoftware.com/rbpage/index.html>
		
		Improved by Thomas Tempelmann 22 Nov 2005 in the following ways:
		- Modified the code a little so that Keydown is less involved. Instead,
		   we let the text get modified by the framework and then update it
		   afterwards.
		- Removed the EditPaste handler and instead have multi-lines handled
		   by getNonGray now.
		- Made all local methods and properties "protected",
		- Changed "GrayList" array from being 1-based into 0-based.
		- Added public properties CompletionChar, CompletionSelectsAll and
		   CompleteOnLostFocus to allow customization.
		- Added this note.
		
		Changes on 22 Nov 2005:
		- instead of using an array for the possibl items, Events are used

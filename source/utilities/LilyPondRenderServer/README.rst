A rendering server for OpenSong using LilyPond to render songs with musical notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current version is preliminary. The format in which notes are stored
in the OpenSong database can still change and definitely will be extended.
The current server is command line only.

**Prerequisites**: LilyPond, Python3

This is also one of my first bigger learning-Python projects. So if you are a
more advanced Python user, please, point me to all the bads in my code :-)

The latest distributions can be found in the
https://sourceforge.net/p/opensong/code/HEAD/tree/source/utilities/LilyPondRenderServer/dist
folder

Install with a command like:

    pip3 install LilyPondRenderServer-0.1.5-py3-none-any.whl

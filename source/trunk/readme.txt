Welcome to OpenSong

Releases
The latest release is available from http://www.opensong.org/pages/downloads.html

Build It Yourself
OpenSong is created using Xojo (formerely known as RealBasic) using the proprietary VB-look-alike language RealBasic.
At time of writing this documentation, the code is fully compatible back to RealBasic 2010r5.1.

The Xojo IDE for developing and testing OpenSong is free on all platforms. To build your own version of OpenSong you need to purchase a license.
To make your own OpenSong:
- Download and install Xojo (https://xojo.com/download/) and the source code of the newest OpenSong release.
- As of Xojo, setup the Microsoft Office plugin, by copying the file MSOfficeAutomation.rbx located in the directory 'Extras/Office Automation' to the directory 'Plugins'.
- Compile the source code, placing it in a suitable location.
- The first time you run OpenSong it will create the necessary folders and settings files. However, you will need to manually add song files and backgrounds to their proper folders.

OpenSong on MacOS
With the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the new GateKeeper functionality is now in effect.  
This means that new apps like OpenSong that are downloaded or copied to a Mac with Mountain Lion, but that are not digitally signed, display a 'Mountain Lion Error for Unsigned Applications' error.
This error can be overridden in System Preferences, by changing the "Allow applications downloaded from" setting to "Anywhere".

OpenSong on Linux
Running OpenSong on Linux works, but on some distributions you might need to tune things.
See the Wiki on http://www.opensong.org/pages/opensong-linux.html for more information.
